# College projects
In college I had the opportunity to develop a lot of algorithms, and I decided to create this repository to register the ones I consider the most important.

# 1. Huffman's Tree
This algorithm emulates the Huffman's Tree. The Huffman algorithm receives a bit stream and returns a compressed bit stream representing the original stream. In general, the compressed flow is shorter than the original.
